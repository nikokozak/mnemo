# Mnemo TODO

- Refac of mnemo
- Documentation / Tests for controllers (fixtures).
- Script for running "project" in dev mode (i.e. ensure postgres started, web_client & mnemo all started)
- Scheduling engine.
- OAuth integration. (front/back)
- CircleCI build system (actually fix, automate so deployments are working, demoable)
