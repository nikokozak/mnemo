# Mnemo TODO

- Retrieve last previous "completed_review_block" to assess next interval (currently we're starting from scratch every time, and thus getting the same interval)
- Quantum scheduler.
- Make schedule of features, looking into December.
- Ideate marketing materials/strategy (signups, landing page, etc.).
- Refac / Design elements in viewer / editor (centralize markup of things like buttons through tailwind classes, general structure).
- Student Home should be a liveview.
- Documentation / Tests for managers.
- Test for liveview.
- Script for running "project" in dev mode (i.e. ensure postgres started, web_client & mnemo all started)
- OAuth integration. (front/back)
- CircleCI build system (actually fix, automate so deployments are working, demoable)
